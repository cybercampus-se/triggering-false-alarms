# T1202 - Indirect Command Execution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106). For example, [Forfiles](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0193), the Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), Run window, or via scripts. (Citation: VectorSec ForFiles Aug 2017) (Citation: Evi1cg Forfiles Nov 2017)

Adversaries may abuse these features for [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005), specifically to perform arbitrary execution while subverting detections and/or mitigation controls (such as Group Policy) that limit/prevent the usage of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) or file extensions more commonly associated with malicious payloads.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #6 - Indirect Command Execution - ssh.exe](#atomic-test-6---indirect-command-execution---sshexe)

<br/>

## Atomic Test #6 - Indirect Command Execution - ssh.exe
The ssh.exe utility can be abused to proxy execution through the ProxyCommand, allowing for the execution of programs and commands. 
In this case, calc.exe is executed through ssh, which can be used as a defense evasion technique.
